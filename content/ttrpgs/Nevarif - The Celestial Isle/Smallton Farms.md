# [[Smallton Farms]]

Once a humble family farm, Smallton Farms is now an industrial powerhouse supplying its parent company, [[Smallmart]] with most of its supply. Both companies are owned by [[Ma Smallton]] and [[Pa Smallton]]

It is alleged that The Smalltons abuse Halfling and [[Kobold]] labour.
