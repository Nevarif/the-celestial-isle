# [[Suffer Moves]]

These moves are made as a result of a perilous event or bad outcome on other moves. They represent what happens to you, and how you hold up against the trauma.

- **When you face physical damage,** make the _Endure Harm_ move (page 91). 
- **When you score a miss on the Endure Harm move, and your health is at 0**, you may need to _Face Death_ (page 93).
- **When your companion is exposed to harm,** make the _Companion Endure Harm_ move (page 94).
- **When you are demoralized, afraid, or acting against your best intentions**, make the _Endure Stress_ move (page 95).
- **When you score a miss on the Endure Stress move, and your spirit is at 0**, you may need to _Face Desolation_ (page 96).
- **When your supply falls to 0,** all characters make the _Out of Supply_ move (page 97). If you are at 0 supply and suffer additional -supply, you each need to reduce your health, spirit, or momentum tracks by that amount.
- **When your momentum track is at its minimum (-6), and you suffer additional -momentum**, make the _Face a Setback_ (page 97) move. 

Making a suffer move is not, however,the only possible outcome of a failure. You might face story complications or new dangers. You might lose an item. Your relationship with another character might be tested. Keep it fresh and interesting. When in doubt, _Ask the Oracle_.
