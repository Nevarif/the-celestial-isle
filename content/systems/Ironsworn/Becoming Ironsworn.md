# [[Becoming Ironsworn]]

In your first session, envision your current situation. Something has happened—or is about to happen—which puts you on the path of the Ironsworn. This is your **inciting incident**. Make it personal. Give it teeth. It’s not a situation you can just walk away from. You must set things right. 

If you need inspiration for this starting situation, have a look at the prompts for vows in chapter 4 - ‘Your World’ (page 111) and chapter 5 - ‘Foes and Encounters’ (page 133). Or, you can _Ask the Oracle_ (page 107) and interpret the meaning of the answer.

To learn more about starting your campaign, see page 193. Then, _Swear an Iron Vow_ and play to see what happens.
