# [[Harm]]

**Harm** represents physical damage and fatigue. You inflict harm on your foes in combat, and you _Endure Harm_ when you are attacked or fail to overcome a physical hazard or ordeal.

## Inflicting Harm

When you successfully attack a foe using the _Strike_ (page 79) or _Clash_ (page 80) moves, you inflict harm. If you are armed with a deadly weapon (such as a sword, axe, spear, or bow), you inflict 2 harm. If you are unarmed or using an improvised or simple weapon (such as a shield, stick, club, staff, or rock), you inflict 1 harm. You may have an option to inflict additional harm through the choices you make in a move.

Each point of harm you inflict is marked as progress on your foe’s progress track, as appropriate to their rank. For example, each point of harm equals 2 ticks when fighting an extreme enemy, or 2 full progress boxes when fighting a dangerous enemy.

## Enduring Harm

When you face physical injury or hardship, make the _Endure Harm_ move (page 91). As part of that move, you reduce your health track by the amount of harm suffered. There are five ranks of harm.

- **Troublesome (1 harm):** An attack by a minor foe, a painful injury, or a tiring effort.
- **Dangerous (2 harm):** An attack by a skilled foe or deadly creature, a nasty injury, or a demanding effort.
- **Formidable (3 harm):** An attack by an exceptional foe or mighty creature, a serious injury, or an exhausting effort.
- **Extreme (4 harm)**: An overwhelming attack by a monster or beast, a grievous injury, or a debilitating effort.
- **Epic (5 harm)**: An attack by a legendary foe of mythic power, a horrific injury, or a consuming effort.

When you are fighting a foe, they inflict harm based on their rank. Sample foes are in chapter 5 (page 133). 

If you are at 0 health, a miss on the _Endure Harm_ move puts you at risk of suffering a debility or dying. You can recover health through rest and recuperation, using moves such as _Heal_ (page 63), _Make Camp_ (page 64), and _Sojourn_ (page 71).
