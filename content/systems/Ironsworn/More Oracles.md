# [[More Oracles]]

Roleplaying games have a long tradition of using random generators as a play aid. If you’re an avid collector of RPG’s, you may wish to leverage oracles from other systems. You can also find a limitless supply of random generators and tables online—names, people, creatures, places, plot hooks, and much more.

Physical randomizers can also be helpful. You can purchase dice with various icons that can be interpreted to resolve questions and trigger new situations. Or, you can play with tarot cards or rune stones. 

Whatever aids you use, don’t let randomness overwhelm your narrative. Your own story instincts are the most powerful tool in your gaming kit.

## Creating Your Own Oracles

You will find a blank worksheet at ironswornrpg.com to create your own oracle tables. You can make tables which better fit your preferences or support the tone of your game.

You can also create specific tables for certain narrative situations. Heading out for a dangerous journey into the mountains? Create a table of things you might encounter. Then, roll on the table when you want to introduce an encounter or event.
