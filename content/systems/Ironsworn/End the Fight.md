# [[End the Fight]]

> [!info] End the Fight
> _Progress Move_
> 
> When **you make a move to take decisive action**, and score a strong hit, you may resolve the outcome of this fight. If you do, roll the challenge dice and compare to your progress. Momentum is ignored on this roll.
> 
> On a **strong hit**, this foe is no longer in the fight. They are killed, out of action, flee, or surrender as appropriate to the situation and your intent (_Ask the Oracle_ if unsure).
> 
> On a **weak hit**, as above, but you must also choose one.
> - It’s worse than you thought: _Endure Harm._
> - You are overcome: _Endure Stress_.
> - Your victory is short-lived: A new danger or foe appears, or an existing danger worsens.
> - You suffer collateral damage: Something of value is lost or broken, or someone important must pay the cost.
> - You’ll pay for it: An objective falls out of reach.
> - Others won’t forget: You are marked for vengeance.
> 
> On a **miss**, you have lost this fight. _Pay the Price_.

_End the Fight_ fulfills your previous moves and the progress you have made in this scene. This is the all-or-nothing moment where the fight is decided. Is your foe defeated? Is your victory a pyrrhic one, and tastes of ash? Does your foe suddenly turn your assumed advantage against you?

Since this is a progress move, you add the number of filled boxes on your progress track for this foe, whether it’s a single enemy or a pack. This is your progress score. Only add fully filled boxes (those with four ticks). Then, roll your challenge dice, compare to your progress score, and resolve a strong hit, weak hit, or miss as normal. You may not burn momentum on this roll, and you are not affected by negative momentum.

You can _End the Fight_ only after you score a strong hit on a preceding move. Your setup move can be any action, but should be framed as a decisive maneuver or response, intended to bring the fight to a close.

If you find yourself struggling against a tide of weak hits and misses, unable to make this move, consider building and then burning momentum to get back control. Use your favored stats and assets to improve your chances. However, keep in mind that _End the Fight_ is not the only way to resolve a combat scene. You can flee. You can give up. You can negotiate or force a surrender. _End the_ _Fight_ represents the conclusion of a bloody, desperate combat, with both sides committed to see it through. 

On a strong hit, envision how this foe is defeated. If you still face other foes (using separate progress tracks), you have initiative and the fight continues. 

If you score a weak hit, your victory comes at a cost. Choose a listed outcome as appropriate to the circumstances. Then, consider the narrative implications of your choice and how it impacts what happens next. 

On a miss, you should face a dramatic and dire consequence. Are you captured? Mortally wounded and left for dead? Is someone under your protection killed? Is an important objective or vow now lost to you? Make a choice as appropriate to the situation and the intent of your foe, or roll on the _Pay the Price_ table and interpret the result as severe. Make it hurt.

When you and your allies are fighting against a common foe, you share a progress track. Any of you may attempt to _End the Fight_. If you then score a weak hit or miss, consider how your choice impacts the group and who suffers the cost as appropriate to the situation.
