Some vows are held so fiercely that they survive even after death. An iron revenant is an incorporeal force of furious resolve, the unfinished vow of an Ironsworn given horrible form as a construct of metal. 

Attacks may slow them down or temporarily break apart their armored form, but they have no flesh to pierce and cannot be killed. An iron revenant won’t stop until their vow is fulfilled. 

_Quest Starter: Someone you knew has taken form as an iron revenant. Who is it? What is their vow?_
