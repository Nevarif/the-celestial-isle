# [[Gather Information]]

> [!info] Gather Information
> When **you search an area, ask questions, conduct an investigation, or follow a track**, roll +wits. If you act within a community or ask questions of a person with whom you share a bond, add +1.
> 
> On a **strong hit**, you discover something helpful and specific. The path you must follow or action you must take to make progress is made clear. Envision what you learn (_Ask the Oracle_ if unsure), and take +2 momentum. 
> 
> On a **weak hit**, the information complicates your quest or introduces a new danger. Envision what you discover (_Ask the Oracle_ if unsure), and take +1 momentum. 
> 
> On a **miss,** your investigation unearths a dire threat or reveals an unwelcome truth that undermines your quest. _Pay the Price_.

Use this move when you’re not sure of your next steps, when the trail has gone cold, when you make a careful search, or when you do fact-finding.

There’s some overlap with other moves using +wits and involving knowledge, but each has their purpose. When you’re forced to react with awareness or insight to deal with an immediate threat, that’s _Face Danger._ When you size up your options or leverage your expertise and prepare to make a move, that’s _Secure an Advantage_. When you’re spending time searching, investigating, asking questions—especially related to a quest—that’s when you _Gather Information_. Use whichever move is most appropriate to the circumstances and your intent.

A strong hit means you gain valuable new information. You know what you need to do next. Envision what you learn, or _Ask the Oracle_. 

With a weak hit, you’ve learned something that makes your quest more complicated or dangerous. You know more about the situation, but it’s unwelcome news. To move forward, you need to overcome new obstacles and see where the clues leads. 

On a miss, some event or person acts against you, a dangerous new threat is revealed, or you learn of something which contradicts previous information or severely complicates your quest.
