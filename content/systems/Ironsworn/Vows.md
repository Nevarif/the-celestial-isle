# [[Vows]]

When you _Swear an Iron Vow_ (page 98), you give it a rank (troublesome, dangerous, formidable, extreme, or epic), and record it on your character sheet. You then use a vow progress track to mark when you _Reach a Milestone_ (page 100).

> [!tip] Start your session with two vows
> **You should start your first session with two vows: A long term goal (your background vow) and an immediate situation which must be dealt with (your inciting incident). You’ll find quest starters in chapter 4 - ‘Your World’ (page 111) and chapter 5 - ‘Foes and Encounters’ (page 133).**
