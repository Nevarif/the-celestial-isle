# [[Moves]]

**Moves** are self-contained systems to resolve a specific action, scene or question. There is a move for most common situations you encounter in _Ironsworn_. They have specific **triggers**, phrased as “When you [blank].” When your character does that thing, or you encounter that situation, refer to the move to see what happens.

Moves are organized by activities. 
- **Adventure moves ([[Adventure Moves|page 60]])** cover a variety of dangers, conducting investigations, traveling, making camp, and healing.
- **Relationship moves ([[Relationship Moves|page 69]])** involve persuading others to do something, building bonds with people and communities, resting and recuperating within a community, aiding your allies, and initiating duels.
- **Combat moves ([[Combat Moves|page 78]])** are used when fighting (but not exclusively; other moves may come into play as well).
- **Suffer moves ([[Suffer Moves|page 90]])** occur when you endure hardship, such as suffering physical harm or facing a dispiriting challenge.
- **Quest moves ([[Quest Moves|page 98]])** encompass iron vows, making progress in a sworn quest, and improving your character.
- **Fate moves ([[Fate Moves|page 104]])** help you decide what happens in solo and co-op play, or support the GM’s decisions and brainstorming in guided play.

When a move’s name is referenced within these rules or by another move, you’ll see it as _italicized text_. 

Most moves are based on risky actions you are taking. You are attacking with your sword, making a dangerous climb, or healing an ally. These moves use dice to determine the outcome. This is called an **action roll** (page 8).

Some moves measure your headway against an extended challenge, such as a journey or fight, using a **progress track** (page 14). When you are ready to resolve the challenge, you make a **progress roll** (page 18).

Other moves utilize a different kind of dice roll, called an **oracle roll** (page 22). These moves help determine the outcome of uncertain events out of your character’s control. If you’re playing solo or co-op, you can use the _Ask the Oracle_ move (page 107) to answer questions about the world, resolve how other characters respond, or determine what happens next. 

Some moves don’t require a roll. They might support or reference a separate move, or simply help you resolve a mechanical or narrative situation. Don’t roll dice unless a move tells you to. To learn more about moves, see page 49.
