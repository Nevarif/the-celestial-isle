Giants dwell in the Tempest Hills and Veiled Mountains. They live a nomadic life alone or in small family units, herding oxen, mountain goats, and sheep. In their own language they are called the Jokul. 

Many Ironlanders misinterpret their quiet nature for dullness, but giants are keenly intelligent and observant. They have a great respect for life, even for our kind, and use trickery and negotiation to avoid fights. When they are left without other options, an enraged giant is a devastating, relentless force.

_Quest Starter: A pair of giants are raiding human settlements, stealing supplies and livestock. With winter coming, the survival of those settlements is threatened. What is driving the giants down from the hills?_
