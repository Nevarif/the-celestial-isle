In solo or co-op play, use this move when you have a question or want to reveal details about your world. In guided play, the GM may use this move to answer their own questions or inspire the story of your game session.

## Draw a conclusion

The most basic use of this move is to simply decide the answer. Think it over for a moment (or talk it out with others at your table), and go with what seems most appropriate to the current situation and introduces the most potential for drama and excitement.

Your first instinct is often the right one. If it leapt to mind, it’s probably a good fit for the current situation. But, if your initial impulse doesn’t really excite or interest you, give it more thought. Wait for an “aha” moment. 

If you’re still not sure of the answer, or want to put things in the hand of fate, you have some other options...

## Ask a Yes/No question

You can ask a binary yes/no question and leave the answer open to fate. 
- “Is this steading inhabited?”
- “Do I drop my sword?”
- “Is there somewhere I can hide?”
- “Do I know the way?”
- “Would they consider this trade?”

Decide the likeliness of a ‘yes’ answer, and roll your oracle dice to get the result. For example, if you rate the chance of a ‘yes’ as ‘unlikely’, you must roll 76-100 for a yes. Otherwise, the answer is no.

Almost Certain: `dice: [[Ask the Oracle#^almostcertain]]`
Likely: `dice: [[Ask the Oracle#^likely]]`
50/50: `dice: [[Ask the Oracle#^fiftyfifty]]`
Unlikely: `dice: [[Ask the Oracle#^unlikely]]`
Small Chance: `dice: [[Ask the Oracle#^smallchance]]`

## Pick Two

The next option is to ask a question and pick two viable results.
- “Do I drop my sword or my shield?”
- “Is it in the forest or the hills?”
- “Does the elder bear try to pin me down, or does it bite?”
- “Am I attacked by a horror, or a beast?”
- “Is this a formidable foe, or a dangerous one?”

You rate one of those as ‘likely’, and roll on the table. If it’s a ‘yes’, the answer is your likely pick. If not, it’s the other. Use this approach when the answer is more open-ended, but you have a couple of options in mind.

Likely: `dice: [[Ask the Oracle#^likely]]`

## Spark an idea

The final option is to seek inspiration through an open-ended question.

- “What happens next?”
- “What do they want?”
- “What’s this place look like?”
- “What do I find?”
- “Who or what attacks?”

If you’re in a game with other players, you can talk it out. Brainstorming together will lead you to interesting answers you might not have thought of on your own.

You can also use random generators to help inspire an answer. See chapter 6 (page 165) for creative prompts and random results. Or, use your preferred tools, such as an online generator for interesting names, or a set of tarot cards or rune stones for visual inspiration. When asking an open-ended question, use tools which offer a spark of inspiration instead of a definitive response. Your creative mind will lead you naturally from an abstract concept to a relevant answer, adding exciting and surprising dimension to your story.

Within the oracles worksheet (available at ironswornrpg.com) you will find a set of blank tables to create your own oracles. If you are setting off on a journey, you might fill a table with things you expect to encounter. When you want to trigger an event, roll on that table. 

## Questions upon questions

You can come back to the yes/no table and ask a follow-up question to clarify or affirm a result. However, you should avoid leaning too heavily on asking questions (or this move in general). Don’t let one question snowball into a series of more specific questions. Even when playing solo, oracles should be the spice of your game, not the main course. Ask a question or two, decide what it means, and move on. When in doubt, follow your gut. Your first instinct is probably the right one. Go with it.

### Rolling a match

A match on your oracle dice when rolling on the yes/no table should trigger an extreme result or narrative twist. This can mean an all-caps “HELL YES!” or “HELL NO!”, or a yes or no but with an interesting or dramatic complication.

When you’re unsure what a match might mean, you can roll on another oracle table (page 167) for inspiration. If you’re still left scratching your head, just move on. Resolving a match is not a requirement. It’s just a way to introduce narrative turning points that lead you along unexpected paths. Head down the rabbit hole, but don’t get stuck in it.

### Oracles and guided play

In guided play, your GM is the oracle. You won’t make this move unless you are talking things out and need a random result or a bit of inspiration. Your GM can use this move (or ask you to make it) to help guide the story
