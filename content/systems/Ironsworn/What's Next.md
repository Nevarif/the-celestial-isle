# [[What's Next]]

That’s the basics of playing _Ironsworn_. You’ll see these concepts referenced and expanded throughout this rulebook, but it’s not necessary to read or understand it all before playing. To get started:

**Create your character (page 31)**. Set your stats, select your assets, and consider your background and personality.

**Build your world (page 111)**. Take a tour of the Ironlands, create your unique vision of the setting, and find inspirational prompts for vows and quests. Or, start playing in your own world.

**Review the moves (page 49)**. It’ll be helpful to get a basic understanding of the moves and how you resolve your character’s actions and intent. You can start by printing out the move reference sheets, available at ironswornrpg.com. Then, refer to chapter 3 when you have a question or want further detail.

**Review the example of play (page 241).** See _Ironsworn_ in action to help understand the basic die roll mechanics, how to interpret moves and outcomes, and how to use creative prompts to drive your story forward.

**_Swear an Iron Vow_ (page 98).** Play to see what happens. When you have questions about moves, see page 49. When you need a foe or encounter, see page 133. When you seek answers from an oracle, see page 165.

**Dig deeper (page 193)**. When you’re ready to explore campaign setup guides, additional gameplay options, and best practices, see chapter 7.
