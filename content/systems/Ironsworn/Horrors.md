# [[Horrors]]

Horrors are supernatural entities. In the Old World, they were superstition and legend. Here, they are nightmares made real. The Ironlands is fertile ground for darkness and evil to take hold, spawning these undead beings of pure vengeance or mindless hate.Â 

Many horrors can be temporarily defeated through physical attacks, but cannot be killed. They are beyond death.

To determine the role of horrors in your setting, see [[Horrors Truths|page 129]].
