# [[Experience]]

When you _Fulfill Your Vow_ (page 101), you gain **experience**. The amount of experience is based on the rank of the quest, and ranges from 1 to 5 points. Mark an ‘X’ on your character sheet for each point you’ve earned.

When you _Advance_ (page 103), you spend experience to purchase assets or upgrade an asset. Replace the ‘X’ for each point spent with a filled-in dot.

Per the _[[Advance]]_ move, you may:
- **Add a new asset** by spending 3 experience.
- **Upgrade an asset** by spending 2 experience. 

> [!tip] Start with 0 experience
> **To start, your experience is unmarked.**
