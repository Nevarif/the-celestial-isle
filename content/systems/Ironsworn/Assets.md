# [[Assets]]

**Assets** are a key component of your character. They give you additional options and bonuses when making a move, and may include their own special moves. When you create your character (page 31), you select your starting assets. When you _Fulfill Your Vow_ and gain experience (page 44), you can _Advance_ to spend your experience on new assets or upgrade current assets.

To learn more about assets, see page 39.

> [!tip] Mix and match assets
> You can mix-and-match assets however you like. There are no designated assets based on character classes or roles. However, you should avoid picking the same asset as another player.
