Some who fall prey to the long winters or the wild storms of the northern regions are given a horrible new life as the frostbound. These animated corpses are cursed to forever seek out the warmth their death took from them.

_Quest Starter: A group of frostbound lurk along a mountain trail. This path is the only safe route to the lowlands from a mining village._

> [!question] Your Truth
> Can creatures other than Ironlanders become frostbound? If so, undeath gives them uncanny strength. Make them one rank higher than their living form.
