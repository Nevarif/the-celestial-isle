# [[Bonds]]

As you explore your world and complete quests, you create bonds with people and communities by making the _Forge a Bond_ move (page 74). Bonds give you advantages for specific moves when interacting with those you have bonded with. For example, if you attempt to _Compel_ someone (page 69), and you share a bond with them, you add +1 to your action score. The moves tell you when having a bond provides this advantage.

Bonds also help determine your fate when you retire from your life as an adventurer. The more bonds you create, the more connections you have with people and communities, the better your chance to live out your days peacefully in the company of others.

Your character sheet has a special progress track for bonds. When you successfully _Forge a Bond_, mark 1 tick on this progress track. When your adventures are complete and you _Write Your Epilogue_ (page 77), tally your bonds and make a progress roll (page 18) to wrap up your characterâ€™s story.
