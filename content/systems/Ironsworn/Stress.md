# [[Stress]]

**Stress** represents mental burdens and trauma. When you face mental shock or despair, make the _Endure Stress_ move (page 95). As part of that move, you reduce your spirit track by the amount of stress suffered. There are five ranks of stress.

- **Troublesome (1 stress):** An unsettling incident or frustrating failure.
- **Dangerous (2 stress):** A distressing incident or upsetting failure.
- **Formidable (3 stress):** A horrifying incident or demoralizing failure.
- **Extreme (4 stress):** A heart-rending incident or traumatic failure.
- **Epic (5 stress):** A soul-shattering incident or the loss of all hope.

When you are opposing a foe, they can inflict stress (such as a terrifying visage or demoralizing taunt) based on their rank. Sample foes are in chapter 5 (page 133). 

When you _Endure Stress_, you reduce your spirit track by the amount of stress suffered. If you are at 0spirit, you are in danger of suffering a debility or falling into desolation.

You can recover spirit by relaxing when you _Make Camp_ (page 64), finding fellowship when you _Sojourn_ (page 71), or when you _Forge a Bond_ (page 74).

Unlike harm, you do not inflict stress on others—at least not mechanically. If you attempt to frighten or demoralize another character, make an appropriate move to see what happens.
