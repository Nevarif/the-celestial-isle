Elder beasts—including wolves, bears, and boars—are huge, monstrous versions of their common kin. They are primarily solitary creatures, though elder wolves have been known to lead a pack of normal wolves. Some call them guardians, avatars of the land itself, and say they are as long-lived as the oldest trees. 

_Quest Starter: An elder wolf, white as snow, appears to you in a dream. When you wake, the memory of its piercing gaze lingers. Is the vision a dark portent or a promise? Why are you compelled to seek this beast out?_
