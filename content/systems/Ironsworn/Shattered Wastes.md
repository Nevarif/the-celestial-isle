# [[Shattered Wastes]]

## Features

- Vast fields of broken ice
- Discomforting stillness
- Deep crevasses, plunging into darkness
- Piercing cold
- Unnatural horrors breaking through the ice

To the north of the Veiled Mountains lies the Shattered Wastes, a plain of jagged, broken ice.Â 

No one knows the bounds of this land or what lies beyond. No Ironlanders dwell here, and only a handful have explored the passage into the Wastes through the Veils. Those who survived the journey returned with stories of unimaginable cold and _things_ moving beneath the ice.

_Quest Starter: The traveler returned from his journey into the Shattered Wastes with dead, frostbitten hands and extraordinary stories. The others scoff at him, but you believe. Why? What does he tell you? What compels you to see for yourself?_
