When your foe has initiative and attacks, and you choose to fight back, make this move.

First, envision your action and the fiction of the exchange. Is this a focused, dramatic moment where you each seek an opening? Or is it a flurry of attacks and parries, advances and retreats? The outcome of the _Clash_ determines if your foe presses their advantage, or if you take control of the fight.

On a strong hit, you inflict your harm and steal back initiative. On a weak hit, you manage to inflict harm, but your foe retains initiative and you must _Pay the Price_. The price might be that you _Endure Harm_ as your foe counters. Or, you may face some other dramatic outcome as appropriate to the current situation and your foe’s intent.

On a miss, you fail to inflict harm and must _Pay the Price_. This fight is turning against you.

As with the _Strike_ move, each point of harm you inflict is marked on your foe’s progress track, as appropriate to their rank (page 134). 

If you aren’t actively fighting back—you’re just trying to avoid the attack or seeking cover—you should _Face Danger_ instead of _Clash_. Using that move gives you more flexibility to bring a favored stat into play, and you suffer a relatively minor cost on a weak hit. Unfortunately, you also give up the opportunity to inflict harm on your foe. See page 85 for more about using _Face Danger_ in a fight.

If you ever respond to an attack by just taking the hit, that’s not a move. The outcome isn’t in much doubt. _Pay the Price_.
