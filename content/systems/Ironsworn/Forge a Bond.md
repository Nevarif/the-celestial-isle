# [[Forge a Bond]]

> [!info] Forge a Bond
> When **you spend significant time with a person or community, stand together to face hardships, or make sacrifices for their cause**, you can attempt to create a bond. When you do, roll +heart. If you make this move after you successfully _Fulfill Your Vow_ to their benefit, you may reroll any dice. 
> 
> On a **strong hit**, make note of the bond, mark a tick on your bond progress track, and choose one.
> - Take +1 spirit.
> - Take +2 momentum.
> 
> On a **weak hit**, they ask something more of you first. Envision what it is (_Ask the Oracle_ if unsure), do it (or _Swear an Iron Vow_), and mark the bond. If you decline or fail, _Pay the Price_.
> 
> On a **miss**, you are refused. _Pay the Price_.

Bonds connect you to the people of the Ironlands. They provide a story benefit by enriching your interactions and creating connections with a recurring cast of characters and familiar places. They also provide mechanical benefits by giving you adds when you make moves such as _Sojourn_ or _Compel_. And, perhaps most importantly, your bonds help determine your ultimate fate when you retire from adventuring and _Write Your Epilogue_.

Bonds can be created through narrative circumstances or through sworn vows. If you’ve established a strong relationship with a person or community, you may _Forge a Bond_ to give it significance. If you make this move after you successfully _Fulfill Your Vow_ in service to them, you have proven yourself worthy and may reroll any dice.

When you _Forge a Bond_ and score a strong hit, mark a tick on your bond progress track (page 36) and make note of your bond.

On a weak hit, they ask more of you. It might be a task, an item, a concession, or even a vow. Envision what they need, or _Ask the Oracle_. If you do it, or _Swear an Iron Vow_, you can mark the bond.

On a miss, they have refused you. Why? The answer should introduce new complications or dangers.

## Bonds and the Fiction

In the fiction of your world, bonds can be ceremonial. If your bond is with a person, perhaps you trade gifts. When you form a bond with a community, they may honor you in their own way. Envision what these ceremonies look like to add color and texture to the setting.

Also, respect the narrative weight of a bond. Don’t declare a bond with everyone in sight to add more ticks to your bond progress track. Your bonds represent true, deep connections.

## Bonds and Allies

If you and your allies act together to _Forge a Bond_ with an NPC or community, only one of you makes the move. Others can _Aid Your Ally_ to provide support. If you are successful, each of you may mark a tick on your bond progress track. Only the character making the move takes the mechanical benefits of a strong hit (+1 spirit or +2 momentum).

Bonds can also be made between allies. One of you makes the move, and both of you may mark the bond on a hit. If you score a weak hit, your ally may decide what they ask of you. On a miss, something still stands between you. What is it? What must you do to form a deeper connection?
