# [[Your Truths]]

For each category in this section, choose one of the three options and make it true for your version of the Ironlands. Your choices set the background and tone of your campaign, and may inspire vows through the quest starters listed with each option.

Not happy with any of the choices? You can also make your own truth.

Some choices in one category may contradict a choice you make in another, but you’re free to bend and twist these options to fit your unique version of the Ironlands. If you find a particular choice to be evocative or interesting, make it work in the setting implied by your other choices. You can even select multiple choices within a single category. There are no rules here. Seeming contradictions can be the foundation of interesting stories.

Your choices may impact your characters and the assets you might reasonably select. For example, if magic is rare or unknown in your world, rituals can be ignored or themed in such a way as to make them more about superstition and subtlety. Feel free to build your world around your characters, or let the world influence or limit your options.

Don’t get mired in building the detail of your setting before you start playing. Leave room for inspiration and surprises. As you play, fill in the blanks to further deepen your narrative and world. You may even discover that some of the choices you make here—which reflect the common knowledge of the people—aren’t the actual truth after all.


> [!tip]- Available separately
> The following section is available as a separate workbook at ironswornrpg.com, making it easy to print and mark your choices. If you are playing co-op or guided, do this as a group as part of your first session to give everyone input into your setting. See page 193 for more on starting your campaign.
