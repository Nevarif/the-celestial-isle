# [[Fulfill Your Vow]]

> [!info] Fulfill Your Vow
> _Progress Move_
> 
> When **you achieve what you believe to be the fulfillment of your vow**, roll the challenge dice and compare to your progress. Momentum is ignored on this roll.
> 
> On a **strong hit**, your quest is complete. Mark experience (troublesome=1; dangerous=2; formidable=3; extreme=4; epic=5).
> 
> On a **weak hit**, there is more to be done or you realize the truth of your quest. Envision what you discover (_Ask the Oracle_ if unsure). Then, mark experience (troublesome=0; dangerous=1; formidable=2; extreme=3; epic=4). You may _Swear an Iron Vow_ to set things right. If you do, add +1.
> 
> On a **miss**, your quest is undone. Envision what happens (_Ask the Oracle_ if unsure), and choose one.
> - You recommit: Clear all but one filled progress, and raise the quest’s rank by one (if not already epic).
> - You give up: _Forsake Your Vow_.


Your path leads here. Your foe is defeated. The relic is found. Your training is complete. The village is saved. The beast is killed. The murder is avenged. Your family’s honor is restored. You are triumphant.

Or are you? Make this move to find out.

Since this is a progress move, you tally the number of filled boxes on your progress track for this quest. This is your progress score. Only add fully filled boxes (those with four ticks). Then, roll your challenge dice, compare to your progress score, and resolve a strong hit, weak hit, or miss as normal. You may not burn momentum on this roll, and you are not affected by negative momentum.

When you and your allies are working to fulfill a common vow, you share a progress track. When it is time to see the vow done, one of you represents the group and make the _Fulfill a Vow_ move. The outcome affects everyone involved. 

On a strong hit, your vow is fulfilled. Mark your experience, clear the vow, and decide what you do next. Do other quests call you into the wilds? Or, do you _Write Your Epilogue_, never again to return to your life as Ironsworn?

On a weak hit, you discover or realize something which leaves your quest unfinished or undermines your success. Envision what you learn (or _Ask the Oracle_), make your choice, and play to see what happens. Whether you leave this behind or take on a new quest should be driven by the fiction and your choices as the character. Have you defeated your foe in a bloody fight, but they use their dying breath to say your true enemy still lives? You might _Swear an Iron Vow_ to hunt them down. Have you helped return the clan chief to power, only to learn their promises were lies? You can _Swear an Iron Vow_ to usurp this deceiver, or simply leave this place, promising never to return. 

On a miss, a turn of events finds you defeated or your true goal is suddenly beyond reach. The band of raiders were a diversion, and a more dangerous force has stolen away with the winter stores. The crown of kings is found, but it is a forgery. You’ve hunted and defeated the wyvern, but discover it was only one of a large flock of beasts. If you choose to press on, the nature of your quest remains the same—protect the village, find the crown, stop the ravages of the wyverns—but most of your progress is undone through this dramatic realization.
