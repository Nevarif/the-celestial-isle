# [[Progress Tracks]]

A **progress track** is used to measure your pace and determine the outcome of a goal or challenge in specific situations.\
- **When you [[Swear an Iron Vow]] (page 98)**, a progress track represents the challenges you overcome on your way to achieving your ultimate goal. 
- **When you [[Undertake a Journey]] (page 65)**, a progress track represents how far you’ve gone and how favorable the travel has been.
- **When you [[Enter the Fray]] (page 78)**, a progress track represents your advantage as you weaken or wound your foes in combat.
- **When you establish a new relationship with a character in your world and [[Forge a Bond]] (page 74)**, you mark your bond on a progress track.

Progress tracks are drawn as a row of ten boxes which you fill in—or **mark**—as you make headway toward a goal. When you initiate a challenge, these boxes are empty.
