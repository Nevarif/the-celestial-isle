# [[Character Bonds]]

As you build relationships and complete quests in the service of others, you create bonds by making the _Forge a Bond_ move (page 74).

Bonds provide narrative texture to your world by fleshing out other characters and communities. They give you places to return to, and people to reconnect with, when your life as Ironsworn has taken its toll. Bonds also provide mechanical benefits when you act within a community or interact with someone with whom you share a bond. For example, the _Sojourn_ move (page 71) gives you a bonus to your action roll if you have a bond with that community.Â 

The bonds progress track on your character sheet represents the connections you have made. When you successfully _Forge a Bond_, you mark progress (one tick). When your time as Ironsworn is done, you _Write Your Epilogue_ (page 77). When you make that move, you tally the number of filled boxes on your bonds progress track as your progress score. See page 14 to learn more about progress tracks and progress moves.

> [!tip] Start with background bonds
> **You should start your first session with up to three background bonds. Make a note of the people or communities you share bonds with, and mark up to three ticks on your bond progress track. To learn more about your first session and your starting bonds, see page 193.**
