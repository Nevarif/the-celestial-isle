*An RPG about Murder*

Source: [Grant Howitt](https://gshowitt.itch.io/the-witch-is-dead)

Once upon a time, there was a kind and wise and beautiful witch who lived in the forest with her familiars, and her life was peaceful and happy until a *FUCKING WITCH-HUNTER* broke into her cottage and dragged her our and *FUCKING MURDERED HER* and now she’s *DEAD*. But if you get revenge and kill him and bring his *EYES* to her corpse within a week she’ll come back to life. Or so you’ve heard. Even if it doesn’t work, at least he’s dead. The Witch-Hunter has retreated to the village, the *FUCKING COWARD*. Get him.

## You are a cute woodland animal.

You have four traits:

- CLEVER (understand/interact with humans)
- FIERCE (scare, drag, push, carry, bite, scratch)
- SLY (sneak, steal, hide)
- QUICK (outpace, climb, evade)

## Roll a d10 to see what you are.

**When you try to do something, roll a D10 and add your most relevant trait.** The GM tells you what number you need to equal or beat. If the task is dangerous, you gain a point of *DANGER* if you fail. If you ever roll equal to or under your DANGER, you’re in serious trouble—dead, trapped, lost, or captured.

**USING MAGIC IS ALWAYS DANGEROUS.**

The GM’s characters don’t use dice; they force you to roll them. 

**Remember**: Most tasks that are normal to humans are really difficult for animals, unless they’re broken down into smaller steps: remember, you don’t have opposable thumbs, and all you know of the human world is what the witch taught you. You can talk to other animals of the same or similar species. (You can lower your danger by solving, or running away from, your problems.)
