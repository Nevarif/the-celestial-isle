# Gutter-born Scum

An ill star smiled upon your birth. Poverty, crime and bad parenting didn’t help either. In your community an honest day’s work was never an option. Not that you ever tried, what are you, some kind of mug? A razor blade and a moonless night are worth a week of chump-work.

| Roll | Specialty                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | **Coward's Jab:** When attacking by surprise, test Agility DR10. On a success, you automatically hit once with a light, one-handed weapon, dealing normal damage +3.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 2    | **Filthy Fingersmith:** Your snaky little digits get into pockets and pick locks with a DR8 Agility test. You also begin with lockpicks!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 3    | **Abominable Gob Lobber:** Your phlegm is viscous, lumpy, vile, and ballistically accurate at short range. You can spit d2 (`dice: 1d2`) times per fight. Roll a DR8 Presence test for accuracy. Targets are blinded, retching and vomiting for `dice: 1d4` rounds. Anyone witnessing this - friend and foe - must make a Toughness test to not also vomit. PCs test DR10 and enemies DR12. |
| 4    | **Escaping Fate:** Every time you use an omen, there is a 50% chance it is not spent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 5    | **Excretal Stealth:** You have an astounding, almost preternatural ability to hide in muck, debris, and filth. When hidden in these conditions, a DR16 Presence test is required to notice you.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 6    | **Dodging Death:** You are so unpleasant, irrelevant, disgusting, and vile that even Death would rather avoid you if it can. On death, if there is even the slightest possibility that you survived, there is a 50% chance that you did. If successful, after 10 rounds you pop back up with `dice: 1d4` HP and an unlikely explanation of your escape.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
