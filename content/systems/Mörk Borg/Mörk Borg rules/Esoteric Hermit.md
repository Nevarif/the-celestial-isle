*The stone of your cave is one with the stars. Silence and perfection. Now the chaos of a fallen world disturbs your rituals and the caul of night grows blacker than your cavern’s gloom. Irritating!*

| ---- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | **Master of Fate:** What use are maps when the substance of causality itself is open to you? You know the right way with a DR8 Presence test.                                                                                                                                     |
| 2    | **A Book of Boiling Blood:** You may open and read from this book once a day. Your enemy must make a DR12 test to prevent this. If they fail, `dice: 1d2` [[Berserker-slayers]] appear from the depths of a forgotten dimension of blood. `dice: [[Esoteric Hermit#^berserkers]]` |
| 3    | **Speaker of Truths:** Twice per day, use your wisdom, knowledge, advice, and inner calm to bring clarity to a creature of your choice. The DR of the next test they undertake is lowered by 4.                                                                                   |
| 4    | **Initiate of the Invisible College:** Once per day, you may summon `dice: 1d2` scrolls: `dice: [[Scrolls#^randomscroll]]`. You can only use each power once. if the scrolls are not used before sunrise, they turn to ash.                                                       |
| 5    | **Bard of the Undying:** You learnt your melodies in the Otherworld. The music of your Harp gives +d4 on reaction rolls.                                                                                                                                                          |
| 6    | **Hawk as weapon:** Your crafty almost-intelligent hawk is loyal only to you. Even without shared language, you understand its cries as it keeps watch, scouts, and swoops to attack foes. Attacks/defence DR10 (claws/bite d4), HP 8.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
