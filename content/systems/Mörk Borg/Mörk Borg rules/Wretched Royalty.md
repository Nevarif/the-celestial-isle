| Roll | Item                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | **The Blade of your Ancestors:** This magnificent and clearly magical talking sword is foppish, unreliable and quietly despises you. It taunts yoru failures and, if continually disappointed, develops a 1 in 6 chance to "accidentally" attack you or your companions. Deals `dice: 1d6+1` damage. Attack/Defence DR is 10.                       |
| 2    | **Poltroon the Court Jester:** While practically useless, personally irritating and an emotional drain, Poltroon's capering actually makes enemies lose their focus in combat. For the first two rounts, you and your allies get +2 on attack/defence.                                                                                              |
| 3    | **Barbarister the Incredible Horse:** Barbarister is magical, intelligent, arrogant, and vain. He can also talk. If you can persuade him to care, Barbarister occasionally adds +2 to Presence tests involving logic and intellect. The horse may be smarter than you and is quite aware of this.                                                   |
| 4    | **Hamfund the Squire:** This intensely cowardly servant acts only as guardian for the scabbard of the cursed sword Eurekia. Once per combat, if Ham can be found, Eurekia may be drawn. The sword does 2d6 (`dice: 2d6`) damage, and for every swing of Eurekia, roll a d6 (`dice: 1d6`). On a 1, the squire is slain and Eurekia vanishes forever. |
| 5    | **The Snake-Skin Gift:** An expensive sandalwood box bound in snakeskin. It contains a seemingly ordinary dagger, wrapped in silk. The dagger does d4 (`dice: 1d4`) damage but on a 1, the target dies immediately of deadly poison weeping from the blade.                                                                                         |
| 6    | **Horn of the Schleswig Lords!:** Once per day, release a blare from this dented old trumpet and test Presence DR12. One creature may make their next non-combat test an automatic success.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
