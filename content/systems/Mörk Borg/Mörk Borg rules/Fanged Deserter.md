# Fanged Deserter

| A burnt-black building in Sarkash. Your home?                              |
| A derelict rotting ship rolling endlessly across a grey sea.               |
| A brothel in Schleswig. Quite a friendly environment.                      |
| Sleeping with dogs in the corner of an inn, waiting for someone to return. |
| Following an army in eastern Wästland.                                     |
| Suckling a wolf in the wild of Bergen Chrypt.                              |

##### Abilities

| Crumpled Monster Mask: Strikes primitive fear into lesser creatures like goblins, gnomes and children. While worn, they check Morale every round.  |
| The Brown Scimitar of Galgenbeck: A stinking sword you pulled from a military shit-ditch. `dice: 1d6` damage. DR10 attack and defence while you wield it. 1 in 6 chance a wounded enemy is smitten with potent sepsis, dying in 10 minutes.|
| Wizard Teeth: Four weird teeth rattle within a blackened pouch. Before battle roll a `dice: 1d6` for each one. For every 6 one of your attacks deals maximum damage.|
| Old Sigûrd's sling: Sigûrd was the strongest man whose throat you ever gnawed. Woven from his long grey hair, this sling has never failed you. `dice: 2d4` damage, requires fist-sized rocks which, perhaps regrettably, are everywhere.|
| Ancient Gore-Hound: Asthmatic, deluded and on its last legs, this wizened creature still has a superb nose and can sniffle up treasure in the most disgusting debris. Attacks with DR10 (bite `dice: 1d6`). Defends with DR12, 10 HP. Becomes frenzied around goblins and berserkers.|
| The Shoe of Death's Horse: It looks normal but since finding it in an obscure crypt you are convinced this shoe came from the horse of Death himself. In your hands it hits with DR10, `dice: d4` damage. 1 in 6 chance the shoe smashes the skull, instantly killing small-to-medium sized creatures. The shoe returns to your hand like a boomerang. |
