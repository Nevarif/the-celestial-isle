### Catastrophes

| Roll | Catastrophe                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | One by one, your teeth fall out. Long, brittle fingernails replace them in your gums. _Your smile is horrific and you find it hard to eat._                                                                                                                                     |
| 2    | You feel fine. It's **fine**. _You pustulate with a magical STD. Those intimate with you will die of plague within `dice: 1d4` days then rise as woeful weeping zombies who track you down in your dreams before finding you in reality._                                       |
| 3    | Your skeleton is possessed by some unearthly force and will do anything to kill you and escape. Drowning or piercing is preferred so the bones are not damaged. **Test Strength DR10** in stressful situations or take `dice: 1d4` damage. _When you die, you become a zombie._ |
| 4    | The illusion of the celestial sphere is lifted. You now see what dwells beyond. And it sees you. Gazing upon a clear night sky drives you mad with fear.                                                                                                                        |
| 5    | Around you falls an unending snow of black ash which only you and the mad can perceive. _Water sickens you from this day on. Only ash, soot, or burnt remains can quench your thirst._                                                                                          |
| 6    | The earth decays around you like wet flesh. You sink 3 feet and cannot climb out without help. Clinging to you, screaming and biting, are `dice: 1d4` translucent, crayfish-like children with your face. HP 3, No armor, Bite/pinch `dice: 1d4`.                               |
| 7    | Your skin tatters like paper, your flesh melts like wax, and your intestines bloat like balloons, bursting and falling out until all that is left is a walking, talking skeleton.                                                                                               |
| 8    | A gnashing gap-toothed mouth splits open on your neck. It spits out your secrets and inner thoughts and can be silenced to sleep only with blood.                                                                                                                               |
| 9    | The sky warps and stars spin like wheels. Thrown one day into the future, you arrive vomiting _Time_ as evaporating silver bile. _A Misery is fulfilled_.                                                                                                                       |
| 10   | Light itself despises you. If you gaze upon a candle, lamp, or torch, it goes out.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 11   | _Within `dice: 1d4` days, a vile cocoon heaves from the ground, soon bursting and spawing your exact clone. It is unintelligent and begins to spread mischief and suffering. This happens every couple of days until the ground is cleansed with holy water or fire._           |
| 12   | Your eyes burn with insufferable agony, bleeding heavily before loosening and falling from their gory pits. You continue to see through them, wherever they are.                                                                                                                |
| 13   | You and a random nearby creature pass out. _When you wake up, your souls have switched. Welcome to your new flesh._                                                                                                                                                             |
| 14   | Five twisted, skeletal arms burst from your back. The hands are mischievous, violent, and terribly cruel.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 15   | Your skin pales then begin to emit a sickly greenish light. _Living things held close to you slowly fall ill. They weaken, their bones become brittle, and their teeth and hair fall out._                                                                                      |
| 16   | The Power works, but fate or a demonic force perverts its effects to your precise disadvantage.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 17   | The croll crumbles to tendrils of fine black powder which reach for your nose and mouth. Make a **DR14 Toughness test** or lose `dice: 1d10` HP.                                                                                                                                |
| 18   | The Power pierces you like a knife, feeding on your anima. You are permanently gaunt and drawn, insatiably hungry. _When resting, you restore only half of the rolled HP._                                                                                                      |
| 19   | You fall through **Refva** into the esoteric dimension of Cube-Violet, a place of mythical obscurity. The walls are smooth, iridescent, and cold. Above, an endless inferno. To leave: `dice: [[Arcane Catastrophies#^escape]]`                                                 |
| 20   | Perhaps it's for the best. HE emerges from the shadows. At least your suffering is short, almost instantaneous, as the two-headed basilisk devours you.                                                                                                                         |

### To leave the Cube-Violet

| Slay riddling **Kulvan** (strong goblin, p. 58) who holds three colorless pearls                                                              |
| Poison a close friend with crumbled Sict-Shroom (Toughness DR16) or -`dice: 1d6` HP and hallucinations). They are found only within the cube. |
| Reach up through the fire to the golden key above. `dice: 1d4` fingers burn to ash.                                                           |
| The cube is perfect, and empty. You can only wait in maddening timeless silence until another fool arrives.                                   |
