# Character Improvement

The game master decides when a character should be improved. It can be after completign a scenario, killing mighty foes or bringing home treasure.

The following things happen:

- `dice: 6d10`: If the result is >= current HP, increase HP by `dice: 1d6`
- Get: `dice: [[Character Improvement#^found]]`
- Roll against each ability: `dice: 1d6`. If >= ability, increase by 1 (max 6). Else decrease it by 1 (min -3).
