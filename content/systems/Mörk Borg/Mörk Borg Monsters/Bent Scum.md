## Description

There are few fiends more fell than poverty or monsters more powerful than hate. In this stricken world, the slums and black alleyways are fecund scum, mothering countless abhorred miscreants. The PC with the highest Presence makes a DR14 test at the start of battle. Failure means a random party member is automatically hit with a cowardly backstab-normal damage +3.

## Bounty

- Captured: 50-120s (wanted, serious crime)
- Dead: 20-70s (wanted, serious crime)
