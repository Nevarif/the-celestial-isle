## Description

In [[Tveland]] relic thieves, defamers and corrupt clerks suffer a punishment of exquisite and deeply impractical cruelty. Their children or grandchildren are enclosed in porcelain dolls then placed in cathedral windows, to die slowly of starvation and heat. Despite warding rituals, many return as vengeful undead, often gathering in large throngs to hunt their tormentors. Their mad gaze demands a Presence DR12 test at the start of combat to avoid being frozen with fear for d4 (`dice: 1d4`) rounds.

## Bounty

- Head: 20s
- Captured: 80s
