## Description

All goblins carry a curse. Once like you, they are now trapepd in the prison of their crazed goblin flesh. Only their eyes reveal the truth: a ruined mind watching its body-prison perform terrible deeds. Even being attacked by goblins sends the curse, carried on the winds of their hate. Hit or miss, it doesn't matter. In the dark of [[Sarkash]], they shoot at passers-by with twanging bows. You must find and kill the goblin before your mind is paralyzed. If the curse-carrying creature still lives d6 (`dice: 1d6`) days after the attack, you will warp irrevocably into one yourself. Then, only the dark of Sarkash will hide you.
