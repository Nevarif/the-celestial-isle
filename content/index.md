 [[Moon Stones]] fly down from the sky to [[Bebe]], [[Lariel]], [[Glacier]], and [[Astra]], individually.
 
 The pulse of their [[Moon Stones]] lead them to [[Starfall Springs]]. Right in the middle of the [[Golden Moon Festival]], our heroes meet while riding a giant floating ferris wheel.

At the [[Knights of Reverence]] booth, [[the winners]] meet [[Kronk]], a Captain of the KOR. [[the winners]] join the [[Knights of Reverence]] allowing them to take jobs from the [[Job Board]]

Officiating the [[Golden Moon Festival]] was [[Showzy]]. While Emissary [[Engelfort]] Bloom came from [[The Capital]] to represent [[The Empire]].

[[the winners]] joined the festival's competition to try and win the grand prize, a rock that look's similar to the group's [[Moon Stones]]. The competition had representatives from each of [[the winners]]' hometowns. Strangely, no one could recognize any of them. 

[[Zumpetor]] from [[Springvale]]
[[Schlorp]] From [[BludRock]]
[[Kivyn]] From [[Richmond]]
[[Karin]] from [[Elderbarough]]



[[Breathstealer]]

The competition measured feats of Strength, Agility, Cunning, Beauty, and Talent and used ancient control magic to keep the [[monsters/5e/Awakened Tree|Awakened Tree]], [[monsters/5e/Giant Centipede|Giant Centipede]], and [[monsters/5e/Goblin|Goblin]] obedient. Each contestant was equipped with 2 potions of their choice provided by Jerry "[[Jingle]]" Jackson, a traveling Dwarf merchant known to have the most rare and random items.

Strength was determined by measuring the impact of a single attack on the monster of the contestants choosing.

Agility was determined by a race through different terrain.

Cunning was determined by the contestant's ability to take a ball from a [[monsters/5e/Gargoyle|Gargoyle]]'s hand.

Beauty was determined scores by judges, [[Kronk]], [[Engelfort]], and [[Showzy]] judging contestants' hand picked outfits.

Talent was determined through a stage act chosen by the contestants, judged by  [[Kronk]], [[Engelfort]], and [[Showzy]].

While a close competition, it looked like [[Zumpetor]] and crew would close a victory. When all of a sudden the hold over the monsters' minds seemed to break and the  [[monsters/5e/Awakened Tree|Awakened Tree]], [[monsters/5e/Giant Centipede|Giant Centipede]], [[monsters/5e/Goblin|Goblin]], and [[monsters/5e/Gargoyle|Gargoyle]] attacked indiscriminately towards the crowd.

[[the winners]] stepped up and saved the people of [[Starfall Springs]] while [[Engelfort]], [[Zumpetor]], [[Schlorp]], [[Kivyn]], and [[Karin]] were nowhere to be found.

Because of their heroism, the festival decided to add points to [[the winners]] scores allowing [[Bebe]] to come in first place.

Upon receiving their new [[Moon Stones]] and touching it to their own, [[the winners]] were brought into a monochrome plane of existence where they met [[Luna]]. [[Luna]], is a [[Warrior Champions]] from a long time ago who appears in the form of a cat. While far from being able to fully recall past events, he tells you he is a from a time where a great danger approached. [[Warrior Champions]] were selected as avatars of [[Gods]]. Unable to vanquish the threat, the [[Warrior Champions]] banished its evil knowing it would one day come back to finish the job. Accepting this, the [[Warrior Champions]] sealed away their power, along with [[Luna]] so that future generations may stand a chance when the threat returns.

Learning about all this, our heroes from [[the winners]] agree to collect [[Moon Stones]] and prepare themselves to try and save this world.

After the [[Golden Moon Festival]], [[the winners]] take a job from the [[Knights of Reverence]] to "Exterminate Kobold Pests at [[Smallton Farms]]"

[[the winners]] go the [[Smallton Farms]] where they meet [[Ma Smallton]] and [[Pa Smallton]], a pair of friendly, successful dwarf farmers. They explain about their "kobold problem." They claim bandit kobolds have been raiding their property. When [[the winners]] go to investigate, [[Lariel]] lethally injures one of the Kobolds, [[Leo]]. A halfling named [[Wally WIlliams]] intervenes and explains that they aren't bandits. [[Wally Williams]] takes [[the winners]] to the smaller, simpler, but much cozier [[The Village of Halflings and Kobolds]]. We are introduced to [[Toothpick]], an elder halfling who tells us that [[The Smalltons]] hired halflings and kobolds from their village to do the farm labour. Any farms that resisted their hostile takeovers were destroyed by blight or fire. 

After going to confront [[The Smalltons]], [[Ma Smallton]]'s friendly mask dropped and a bitter angry one appeared. Unhappy with [[the winners]] results, she hires [[The Blinkertons]], a group of Eladrin Fey routinely known to assist [[The Empire]] in intelligence or enforcement. While at this meeting [[The Blinkertons]] attack [[Toothpick]] to try and intimidate the [[The Village of Halflings and Kobolds]]. 

After looking throughout [[Starfall Springs]] for help and sending messages to anyone [[the winners]] could think of to help with the [[The Village of Halflings and Kobolds]]., including [[Bebe]]'s and [[Glacier]]'s parents. But came out with very few solutions. However, all the commotion across town made its way up to [[The Empire]]. While [[The Empire]] may not be exactly good or bad, they are bureaucratic. Setting a precedence of unrest throughout the labor party can be dangerous [[The Empire]] as a whole.

[[Engelfort]] Bloom arrived with 8 of his own personal guard members and announced that [[The Empire]] would be taking special interest in this case and act as arbiter to all parties involed. This meeting will take place in 3 days. During this time [[the winners]] train in the village, spy on the opposing side, plot their counter offensive.

One of the younger Kobolds overheard [[The Blinkertons]] and [[The Empire]] planning to attack the [[The Village of Halflings and Kobolds]] through the sewers during the arbitration meeting.
